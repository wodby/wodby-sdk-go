/*
 * Wodby API
 *
 * The Wodby API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which are understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. 
 *
 * API version: 3.x
 * Generated by: Swagger Codegen (https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen.git)
